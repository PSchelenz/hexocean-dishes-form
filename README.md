# Dish form app

A simple form made for sending requests.

## App instalation
The app was created and run using:
1) npm - version **8.13.2**
2) Node - version **16.14.2**

First you need to install all the dependencies with the command below:

```javascript
npm install
```

In case there are any errors during instalation, delete the package-lock.json file, and run the command again.

Then, to start using the app, you have to write another command:

```javascript
npm start
```

which will start a development server.

Then go to your favourite web browser and type **localhost:3000**,
which at default will be the URL that will redirect you to the application.

If it doesn't work, in the command prompt you should see on what URL the app has been set up.


## Work time
About 12 hours.
